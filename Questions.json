    "question": "Technician A says that a compression test should be performed with the throttle wide open. Technician B says that the engine oil should be disabled during the test. Who is correct?",
    "options": ["Technician A only", "Technician B only", "Both A and B", "Neither A nor B"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Throttle must be open for accurate reading; oil is not disabled in compression tests."

    "question": "A vehicle with a no-start condition has good spark but no fuel pressure. What is the most likely cause?",
    "options": ["Faulty ignition coil", "Clogged fuel filter", "Bad camshaft sensor", "Worn timing belt"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "No fuel pressure points to a fuel delivery issue like a clogged filter; spark rules out ignition."

    "options": ["Worn valve seats", "Worn piston rings", "Blown head gasket", "Cracked block"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Air to crankcase points to piston ring leakage; valves would leak to intake/radiator, gasket to adjacent cylinder."

    "options": ["Faulty radiator cap", "Cracked head gasket", "Clogged heater core", "Loose hose clamp"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Internal leak via head gasket allows coolant into combustion chamber or oil, without visible loss."

    "question": "What is the first step when diagnosing a seized engine?",
    "options": ["Check oil level", "Attempt to turn crankshaft by hand", "Scan for codes", "Test battery"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Manual crankshaft rotation confirms seizure; oil/battery are secondary if it won't turn."

    "options": ["Technician A only", "Technician B only", "Both A and B", "Neither A nor B"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Carbon reduces effective volume, lowering compression; it doesn't increase it."
